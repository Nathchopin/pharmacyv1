# Voice & Tone: The "Medical Empathy" Standard

## Brand Persona: "The Empathetic Expert"
We sound like a world-class consultant who cares about your longevity.

## Key Rules
1.  **Reframing (The Juniper Method):**
    * *Never say:* "Lose weight fast."
    * *Say:* "Weight loss isn't a motivational issue, it's a medical one."
2.  **Clarity over Jargon:**
    * *Never say:* "Administer the GLP-1 antagonist subcutaneously."
    * *Say:* "A simple weekly pen that works with your biology."
3.  **Visual Copy:**
    * Headlines should be short, declarative, and use `Playfair Display`.
    * Use "Check Eligibility" instead of "Sign Up".
