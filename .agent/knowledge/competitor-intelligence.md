## 1. UX & Vibe Inspiration (Juniper Data)

### Hero Section Layout

**Primary Headline Strategy**:
- **H1**: "Weight loss isn't a motivational issue, it's a medical one"
- Secondary text: "That's why 150,000 members globally are losing weight and gaining support on Juniper."

**Proof Elements** (positioned immediately after headline):
- ✓ Clinically backed treatments for up to 20% weight loss¹
- ✓ Keep the weight off with long-term strategies beyond treatment
- ✓ Peer-reviewed studies show more significant weight loss on Juniper than medication alone²
- ✓ Trustpilot 4.5 rating badge with logo (visual trust signal)

**Primary CTA Button**:
- **Text**: "Check your eligibility"
- **Placement**: Top right navigation + hero section + sticky throughout page

**Key Copy Patterns**:

**Design Aesthetic**:

- Large hero images showing actual product/people
- Icon-based trust signals (checkmarks, badges)

---

### E. Clinical Questionnaire Flow (Inferred Best Practices)

Based on eligibility criteria and product pages, a robust triage flow should ask:

1. **Age Verification**: "Are you 18 years or older?"
2. **BMI Calculation**: "What is your height and weight?" → Auto-calculate BMI
3. **BMI-Based Routing**:
   - If BMI < 27: Reject (lifestyle advice only)
   - If BMI 27-29.9: Ask "Do you have weight-related health conditions?" (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)
   - If BMI ≥ 30: Proceed
4. **Medical History Screening**:
   - "Do you have a history of thyroid problems?"
   - "Have you ever had pancreatitis?"
   - "Do you have Type 1 diabetes?"
   - "Are you pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant?"
5. **Current Medications**: "Are you taking any other medications?"
6. **Lifestyle Commitment**: "Are you willing to follow a reduced-calorie diet and exercise plan?"

---

### F. GP Notification Requirement

**UK Regulatory Consideration**:
- UK online pharmacies typically require **GP notification** when prescribing weight loss medication
- Boots and Pharmica both operate under GPhC registration
- This should be handled transparently to build trust (e.g., "We'll notify your GP as required by UK regulations")

---

## 3. Strategic Synthesis for DeepFlow

### UX Recommendations (Juniper-Inspired)

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Lead with empathetic, medical framing: "Weight loss is a medical condition, not a motivation issue"
   - Include social proof immediately (reviews, member count)
   - Prominent "Check Eligibility" CTA (top nav + hero + sticky)
   - Money-back guarantee badge

2. **Visual Trust Signals**:
   - Trustpilot/review badges above the fold
   - "GPhC Registered" badge
   - "MHRA Approved" medication labels

3. **Conversion Path**:
   - Single-click to eligibility quiz (avoid multi-page "Learn More" funnels)
   - Pre-fill discount codes in URLs for promotions

### Clinical Logic (Boots/Pharmica Standards)

1. **BMI Triage**:
   - BMI ≥ 30: Auto-approve for GLP-1s
   - BMI 27-29.9: Conditional on comorbidities
   - BMI < 27: Reject with empathy + lifestyle resources

2. **Product Hierarchy**:
   - **Premium**: Mounjaro (22.5% weight loss, £159.99) → "Most effective"
   - **Standard**: Wegovy (17% weight loss, £119.99) → "Clinically proven"
   - **Budget**: Orlistat variants (£14.99-£51.99) → "Affordable option"

3. **Side Effects Transparency**:
   - Use Boots-style plain language: "Most common side effects include reduced appetite, nausea, and feeling fuller faster"
   - Orlistat warning: "Oily stools if high-fat diet consumed"
